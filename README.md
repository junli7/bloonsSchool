# **Italian Brainrot Tower Defense** 
![banner](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

This project is a simple tower defense game. It combines aspects of **BloonsTD** with **italian brainrot**. main objective of the game is to survive as many rounds as possible by placing and upgrading italian brainrot characters. enemies are different variants of humans attempting to traverse the path.

The <ins> GamePanel</ins> class handles visuals (drawing), user input, and the game loop. This includes movement of enemies (humans), monkeys (characters) and wave management. 

The <ins> GameState</ins> class as suggested in the name, manages the state of the game. This includes the money, lives, and wave number. 

The <ins> Monkey</ins> class creates the characters to be placed and manages the upgrading stats and attacking. <ins> MonkeyB</ins> and <ins> MonkeyC</ins> are both child classes of Monkey with specilized abilities: (Exposives and Slowing Projectiles respectively).

<ins> Human</ins> objects are the enemies moving along the path and this movement is handled by the <ins> Map</ins> class. 

<ins> Projectile</ins> represents the objects (projectiles) fired by all monkeys. 

The <ins> SideInfoPanel</ins> class handles the rightmost UI panel, showing general information such as money, wave number, and the characters.

The <ins> UpgradeControlPanel</ins> class inclues a pop-up, allowing for the characters to be upgraded. 

The <ins> SpriteManager</ins> handles loading the images as well as resizing them.

<ins> Mainframe</ins> is the "main" class. This is the class to run to start the application and sets up the main game window and panels.

Types of Methods

This section categorizes and briefly describes the types of methods implemented across the project's classes.
Constructor Methods:

    Initialize new objects of a class, setting up their initial state and dependencies.

Game Logic and Update Methods:

    Implement the core game mechanics, including movement, targeting, attacking, and state transitions. These methods are typically called repeatedly within the game loop.

Drawing and Rendering Methods:

    Responsible for drawing the visual elements of the game onto the screen. This includes paintComponent overrides and helper methods for drawing specific UI elements or game entities.

Event Handling Methods:

    Respond to user input, such as mouse clicks and movements, to trigger game actions. These methods often involve MouseListener and MouseMotionListener implementations.

State Management and Mutator Methods:

    Modify the internal state of objects or the game, often related to resources, health, or progression.

Accessor (Getter) Methods:

    Provide read-only access to the internal state or properties of an object.

Utility and Helper Methods:

    Perform specific tasks that support the main logic, such as calculations, resource loading, specific object creation, or general-purpose computations.

Upgrade and Archetype Methods:

    Manage the progression and specialization of game entities, particularly monkeys. This includes applying stat changes and handling the selection of upgrade paths.

UI Component Styling and Creation Methods:

    Methods specifically designed to style and create Swing UI components, often involving setting colors, fonts, borders, and layout properties.


Rationale

The project is structured using Swing for the graphical user interface, leveraging JPanel for the main game display and Timer for the game loop. MainFrame acts as the primary application window, orchestrating the various panels. Separation of concerns is achieved by having GamePanel manage rendering and interaction, while GameState encapsulates the core game variables and their manipulation. Human and Monkey classes define the core entities with their own update and draw logic. Map class provides the pathfinding data. This modular design aims for maintainability and clarity. use of MouseAdapter and MouseMotionAdapter simplifies event handling for user input. Wave management is designed to support both pre-defined and procedurally generated waves, allowing for extensible gameplay. Monkeys have a clear upgrade path system with archetypes to introduce strategic depth, and specialized monkey types like MonkeyB and MonkeyC extend the base functionality. Projectile class handles the behavior of shots fired by monkeys. Dedicated UI panels (SideInfoPanel, UpgradeControlPanel) improve user experience by providing clear information and interactive elements. SpriteManager centralizes image loading and caching for efficient resource management. UpgradeGUI specifically encapsulates the visual and interaction logic for the upgrade interface, making UpgradeControlPanel cleaner.

Compilation and Execution

This project is a Java Swing application.

To Compile:
Navigate to the root directory of your project where all .java files are located in your terminal or command prompt.

javac *.java

This command will compile all Java source files in the current directory. If your classes are organized into packages, you will need to adjust the javac command accordingly (e.g., javac -d . src/*.java).

To Execute:
After successful compilation, run the application by executing the MainFrame class, which contains the main method.

java MainFrame

This will launch the game window.
