## Intro


This project is a simple tower defense game It combines aspects of **BloonsTD** with **italian brainrot** main objective of the game is to survive as many rounds as possible by placing and upgrading italian brainrot characters enemies are different variants of humans attempting to traverse the path

The <ins> GamePanel</ins> class handles visuals (drawing), user input, and the game loop This includes movement of enemies (humans), monkeys (characters) and wave management 

The <ins> GameState</ins> class as suggested in the name, manages the state of the game This includes the money, lives, and wave number 

The <ins> Monkey</ins> class creates the characters to be placed and manages the upgrading stats and attacking <ins> MonkeyB</ins> and <ins> MonkeyC</ins> are both child classes of Monkey with specilized abilities: (Exposives and Slowing Projectiles respectively)
> [!NOTE]
> Monkeys refers to the towers, inspired from BloonsTd. In this case, the monkeys are italian brainrot characters

<ins> Human</ins> objects are the enemies moving along the path and this movement is handled by the <ins> Map</ins> class 

<ins> Projectile</ins> represents the objects (projectiles) fired by all monkeys 

The <ins> SideInfoPanel</ins> class handles the rightmost UI panel, showing general information such as money, wave number, and the characters

The <ins> UpgradeControlPanel</ins> class inclues a pop-up, allowing for the characters to be upgraded 

The <ins> SpriteManager</ins> handles loading the images as well as resizing them

<ins> Mainframe</ins> is the "main" class This is the class to run to start the application and sets up the main game window and panels

## Types of Methods

### This section categorizes and briefly describes the types of methods implemented across the project's classes

Constructor Methods:

    Initialize new objects of a class, setting up their initial state and dependencies

Game Logic and Update Methods:

    Implement the core game mechanics, including movement, targeting, attacking, and state transitions These methods are typically called repeatedly within the game loop

Drawing and Rendering Methods:

    Responsible for drawing the visual elements of the game onto the screen This includes paintComponent overrides and helper methods for drawing specific UI elements or game entities

Event Handling Methods:

    Respond to user input, such as mouse clicks and movements, to trigger game actions These methods often involve MouseListener and MouseMotionListener implementations

Setter Methods:

    Modify the internal state of objects or the game, often related to resources, health, or progression

Getter Methods:

    Provide read-only access to the internal state or properties of an object

Utility and Helper Methods:

    Perform specific tasks that support the main logic, such as calculations, resource loading, specific object creation, or general-purpose computations

Upgrade and Archetype Methods:

    Manage the progression and specialization of game entities, particularly monkeys This includes applying stat changes and handling the selection of upgrade paths

UI Component Styling and Creation Methods:

    Methods specifically designed to style and create Swing UI components, often involving setting colors, fonts, borders, and layout properties


# Rationale

The project is organized with Swing for the graphical user interface, Timer for the game loop, and JPanel for the main game display. The main application window, MainFrame, coordinates the different panels. GameState contains the essential game variables and their manipulation, while GamePanel handles rendering and interaction, allowing for a separation of concerns. The core entities are defined by the Human and Monkey classes using their own updates and logic. The pathfinding data is provided by the Map class. The goals of this modular design are clarity and maintainability. Event handling for user input is made simpler by using MouseAdapter and MouseMotionAdapter. Wave management enables extensible gameplay by supporting both procedurally generated and pre-defined waves. Specialized monkey types like MonkeyB and MonkeyC expand the basic functionality, and monkeys have a clear upgrade path system with archetypes to add strategic depth. The behavior of monkey shots is handled by the projectile class. By offering interactive features and clear information, dedicated user interface panels (SideInfoPanel, UpgradeControlPanel) enhance the user experience. SpriteManager streamlines resource management by centralizing image loading and caching. UpgradeControlPanel is cleaner because UpgradeGUI specifically encapsulates the upgrade interface's visual and interaction logic.
